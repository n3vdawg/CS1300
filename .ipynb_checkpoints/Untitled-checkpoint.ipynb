    "# Project Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "* This project is a recreation of the famous Oregon Trail videogame. This recreation will be done in the style of a text based adventure game using python as the code for its engine. The point of this project is to practice tackling a large project and learning how to deal with problems that you couldn't have foreseen in the initial design phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is for anyone who would like to play oregon trail again. But this project is also for me because I want to practice programming as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* My technical approach is as follows:\n",
    "    * Create a flowchart of all the tasks I need to complete\n",
    "        * Each task should represent a different scenario in the game and the players position in the game\n",
    "    * Create pseudocode for each task on the flowchart\n",
    "    * Create independent functions and classes to define each scenario and potential outcomes\n",
    "    * Put functions together in an engine using python\n",
    "    * Troubleshoot and debug\n",
    "    * Ship it\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Setbacks include:\n",
    "    * Organizational problems. Can't decide which functions should call which other functions\n",
    "    * Program not working the way I intended. Functions are playing out of order. Might require an overhaul.\n",
    "    * Can't decide how to approach creating graphics that show where the player is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Done\" looks like a game that is playable by my friends and girlfriend. If someone can play it through their first playthrough, it's done.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I've learned to organize my thoughts better. Tackling it without things laid out ahead for me was a huge mistake. It's easier now that I know what tasks I need to tackle and when."
