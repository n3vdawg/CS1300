# Setting up an algorithm

# What do we need to know?

# 1. The cost of the pizza 
# 2. The value of the bill in cash we will use for payment
# 3. Do we have enough cash?
# 4. If we do, how do we compute the value of the change after paying?

# Get the cost for one pizza
# Get the bill value
# If the cash value is bigger than the cost, then calculate the change and display it.

# BEGIN PSEUDOCODE 

# get inputs for all relevant costs and prices
get price1
get price2
get cash1
get cash2 
get cash3

# add total price
total price = price1 + price2

# find average cost per person
avgcost = total price / 3

# add total cash
total cash = cash1 + cash2 + cash3

# compare each cash amount to avgcost
if cash# == avgcost
	output("thank you")
if cash# < avgcost
	output("not enough money")
if cash# > avgcost
	change = cash# - avgcost
	output (change)
end program
