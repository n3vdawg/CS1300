# Algorithm:

# Move Picobot to the northern most corner. 
# Once reached, move picobot south once, and then sweep west and east all the way to the edges.
# Then move down south once and sweep west and east again. 
# Repeat until picobot has reach the southern most corner.

#CODE:

# state 0 with nothing N; N one step
0 x*** -> N 0

# state 0 with something NE; W one step
0 NEx* -> W 0 

# state 0 with something NW; E one step
0 NxW* -> E 0

# state 0 with something NEW; S one step + into st 1
0 NEWx -> S 1

# state 1 with XXXX; E one step 
1 xxxx -> E 1

# state 1 with *Exx; W one step + into st 2
1 *Exx -> W 2

# state 2 with XXXX; W one step
2 xxxx -> W 2

# state 2 with NxWx; S one step + into st 1
2 NxWx -> S 1

# state 1 with NExS; W one step + into st 3
1 NExS -> W 2

# state 2 with NxWS; E one step
2 NxWS -> E 3

# state 3 with xxxx; S one step
3 xxxx -> S 3

# state 3 with xxWS; W one step + into st 1
3 xxWS -> E 1

# state 1 xExS; W one step
1 xExS -> W 3

# state 3 xExS; W one step + into st 3
3 xExS -> W 4

# state 4 xxxx; W one step
4 xxxx -> W 4

# state 4 xxWS; E one step + into st 1
4 xxWS -> E 1
